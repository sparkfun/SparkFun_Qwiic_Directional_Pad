!!! note
    If you've never connected an CH340 device to your computer before, you may need to install drivers for the USB-to-serial converter. Check out our section on "[How to Install CH340 Drivers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers)" for help with the installation.

You will need the has written a library to work with the Qwiic Directional Pad. You can obtain this library through the Arduino Library Manager by searching for "**SparkFun I2C Expander Arduino Library**". Find the one written by SparkFun Electronics and install the latest version. Users who prefer to manually install the library can get it from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_I2C_Expander_Arduino_Library) or download the .ZIP by clicking the button below:
